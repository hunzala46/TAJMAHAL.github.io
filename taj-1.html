   <p><u><h2> Brief Description</h2></u>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in <b>1643</b>, but work continued on other phases of the project for another <b>10 years. </b>
   The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have
   been completed in its entirety in <b>1653</b>
   at a cost estimated at the time to be around <b>32 million rupees,</b>
   which in<b> 2020 </b>would be 
   approximately <b>70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million)</b>.The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.<br>

   <p><u><h2> Inspiration</h2></u>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by <b>Shah Jahan in 1631</b>, to be built in
    the memory of his wife <b>Mumtaz Mahal</b>, who <u>died on 17 June that year,</u>
     while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
     Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed
      in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished 
      five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after 
      the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.</p></div>
 <div><p> <u><h2>Construction</h2></u>The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. 
 Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.
 An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated,
  filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. 
  In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. 
  Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. 
  The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.
  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. </p><p>
  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. It took the 
  efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.
  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and
   crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while 
   the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious 
   and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.
  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone </p><p>
  could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, 
  and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.
   A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport 
   marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty 
   oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.An elaborate 
   post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. 
   Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, 
   into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three 
   subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.
 
 The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining 
 parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed
  in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the </p>
   was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion 
  dates due to differing opinions on "completion". Construction of the mausoleum i
  tself was essentially completed by 1643
   while work on the outlying buildings continued for years.
    Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating
     costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees,
      which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 </div></body></font></html>
